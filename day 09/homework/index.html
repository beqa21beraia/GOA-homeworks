        <h1>AI</h1>
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines,<br>
            particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops <br>
            and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use <br>
            learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined <br> 
            goals. Such machines may be called AIs.</p>
        <h3>How does AI work?</h3>
        <h3>in general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled <br>
            training data, analyzing that data for correlations and patterns,<br>
            and using these patterns to make predictions about future states.</h3>
