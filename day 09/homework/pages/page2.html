        <h3>my fav sport</h3>
        <p>Table tennis (also known as ping-pong or whiff-whaff) is a <br>
            racket sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its <br>
            playing surface being atop a stationary table, rather than <br>
            the court on which players stand. Either individually or in <br>
            teams of two, players take alternating turns returning a <br>
            light, hollow ball over the table's net onto the opposing <br>
            half of the court using small rackets until they fail to do so, <br>
            which results in a point for the opponent.</p>
