            What is machine learning?
        </h1>
        <p>Directly underneath AI, we have machine learning, which involves creating <br>
            models by training an algorithm to make predictions or decisions based on <br>
            data. It encompasses a broad range of techniques that enable computers to learn <br>
            from and make inferences based on data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks</p>
        <p>There are many types of machine learning techniques or algorithms, including <br>
            linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support <br>
            vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), clustering and more. Each of <br>
            these approaches is suited to different kinds of problems and data</p>
